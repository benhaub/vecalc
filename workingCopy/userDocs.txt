vecalc is a vector calculator written in c that can perform mathematical 
operations on a one dimensional array (vector).

///Installation///

- Not sure how installation will work yet

///Running vecalc///

vecalc is a terminal program. It's interface is completely text based.
Once vecalc is installed on your computer, open the command line and
change your working directory to where all the vecalc c files are stored
and issue a command to run vecalc.

///Using vecalc///
Once vecalc is running, the command line should display "vecalc: " and 
be awaiting input. vecalc takes the following commands from this state:

[q] 	    : quit; Same functionality as [e] (end)
[c] 	    : clear; Delete the current vector and start a new one
[p] 	    : print; Output the contents of the vector to the console
[h] 	    : help; Output the list of commands and the usage
[a] [value] : append; extend the vector by one element and fill the element with the value
[+] [value] : scalar plus;  add [value] to each element of the vector
[-] [value] : scalar minus subtract [value] from each element of the vector
[*] [value] : scalar multiply multiply [value] to each element of the vector
[/] [value] : scalar divide divide [value] from each element of the vector
[e] 	    : end; terminate the vecalc program

All commands have the general form [option] [value].
vecalc may also be given intial arguments when running the program:

./vecalc [option] [value]
- Make sure to espace special characters to prevent shell interpretation.
(i.e the multiply command)

You may also send commands in via input redirection. All redirected input
should end with a q option, although it doesn't need to. If you send in a
blank line from a file or here-string, vecalc will close.
